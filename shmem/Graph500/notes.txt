global var: oned_csr_graph g

run_bfs is the BFS  (args are root (int) and pred (int *))
    nlocalverts => local vertices (found in g)
    nglobalverts => global vertices (found in g)

    pred => predecessor map, the function points to this with orig_pred
    pred2 => allocated here, is a modifiable map
    
    elts_per_queue_bit => ??
    ulong_bits => the number of bits in a unsigned long
    queue_nbits => the number of local vertices and elts_per_queue_bit - 1 /
elts_per_queue_bit

    queue_nwords => ??
    queue_bitmap1 => first bitmap?
    queue_bitmap2 => second bitmap?

    first bitmap is set to 0

    local_vertices => list of local vertices
        each one is set to VERTEX_TO_GLOBAL(rank, i);
    masks => list of all bitmasks for an unsigned long?
    
    coding for predecessor map
        i. white => not visited => INT64_MAX
        ii. grey => in the queue => 0 .. nglobalverts-1
        iii. black => done => -nglobalverts .. -1

    predecessor map is initialized locally to all white

    the root node is set to grey 

    mpi windows are created on the predecessor maps and the queues
    
    infinite loop:
        clear the next level of the queue
        pred is copied over pred2
